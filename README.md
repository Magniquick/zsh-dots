# Zsh-dotfiles !
Just my zsh dots : P \
Designed to be as fast as humanly possible (benchmarked with [zsh-bench](https://github.com/romkatv/zsh-bench)), while having every single plugin you could dream of.
## Setup:
Clone this to ~/.config/zsh, and create/appened to /etc/zshenv with the the following -
```zsh
export ZDOTDIR="$HOME"/.config/zsh
```
## Requirements 
Necessary - fzf. \
Optional - timg, atutin, and preferably iTerm2 and homebrew.
## Contibuting
Open a issue, add the output of $TERM_PROGRAM and which format is used by your terminal on https://github.com/hzeller/timg to add image preview support there.
Alternatively, add it to lessfilter and open a pr !

Happy hacking !
